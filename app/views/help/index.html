                <h3>Project Visibility:</h3>
                    <h4>Private:</h4>
                    If a project's visibility is set to Private, no external users may join the project or submit any feedback to the project and
                    will not be shown on the Explore page or appear in search results unless you are member or owner of the project. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Unlisted:</h4>
                    If a project's visibility is set to Unlisted, external users may view project details and submit feedback to
                    the project if they have the project link; however, the project will not be shown on the Explore page or appear in search results unless you are member or owner of the project. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Public:</h4>
                    If the project's visibilty is set to Public, external users can submit feedback to the project and the project will be listed on
                    the Explore page and appear in search results for everyone.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Internal:</h4>
                    In the future, when GroupHub Professional is rolled out, marking a project as Internal will make your project visibility 
                    to only users of your organization (see Future Updates section below for more details). As of now, setting a project's visibility to Internal has the same effect as setting a project's visibility to Private. </p></span></p>
